## Functional languages

**Side effects** occur when a function modifies the
program state outside of its scope. They made formal
verification harder.

While **control-flow** relies on `while, for` loops
and other branching statements in iterative programming, 
functional programming only uses recursion. It is
completely state-less.

**First-class** objects can be dynamically created,
destroyed, passed to a function, returned as a value.
They have all the ''rights'' of other variables, and
can be functions. 

**Higher-order function**: a function that takes a function as
at least one of its arguments.
